# Development

- `npm start` - build and start web server with hot reload for local development
- `npm run dev:build` - build for development without hot reload
- `npm run prod:build` - build for production with optimizations
- `npm run prod` - build and run in production mode

TODO: consider migrating `package.json` entries for the above from `esbuild` CLI to JSON.
